I am trying to create a platform that tries to solve the problem that a lot of students have in universites.This problem is 
that usualy students need good notes for a class and they dont want to attend to the class.But there are some student that have good
notes and they are wiling to share them.Also the student that have the notes want to make sure that the notes are the best that they
can be and if there is a mistake or someone else has something to add to be happy to help.Also they whould like to have some reward for
their constribution and for the time that they spend.

With cryptocurreses it is possible to create a economy from that need.We can give economic insentives to the student that have 
usefull notes for some lesson of a univerity to share it with everyone else and the other students reward them for the constibution 
and get paid if they help for the maitaince of the file or the find a mistake to the notes or phill something up.


The platform will have 2 main parts:
  1.Menu.
    That will be the database of the university ,lesson of university and some basic information for the leeson.
  2.
    That will be the place that the user will upload ,store and share the notes.
    
  
 Some more details for the Menu.
  -The perpuse of the menu is to have as many univercites and classes as it is possible and maintain them updated.
  So we will need to have a econommic insentive that some sudent will want to keep a class up to date all the time.
  
 Some more details for the 2.
